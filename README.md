# Theorem

## Details

> You will provide us with a small README, document or ​GitHub Gist ​detailing the things you couldn’t complete in time (if any) from your plan, and what things you would have done differently had you have 1 week to work on this instead of just 2 days.

1. _Things you couldn’t complete in time (if any)?_

I managed to finished everything we planned.

2. _What things you would have done differently had you have 1 week to work on this deliverable instead of just 2 days?_

- I would have added MongoDB to the project instead of in-memory DB
- Add thank you page if needed after feedback submission
- Add 404 page

List above probably wouldn't take whole week but thats the only features missing from current design/features, after that I would need to discuss aditional features (registration, profile editing etc.)

## How to run

Issue these commands to start

```bash
yarn         # install dependencies
yarn dev     # run dev environment
# The project should be listening on port localhost:3000
```
